      <p>Input assignment 1: 312051</p>
      <p>Each square on the grid is allocated in a spiral pattern starting at a location marked 1 and then counting up while spiraling outward. For example, the first few squares are allocated like this:</p>
      <p>17  16  15  14  13 <br>
18   5   4   3  12 <br>
19   6   1   2  11 <br>
20   7   8   9  10 <br>
21  22  23---> ...</p>
      <p>While this is very space-efficient (no squares are skipped), requested data must be carried back to square 1 (the location of the only access port for this memory system) by programs that can only move up, down, left, or right. They always take the shortest path: the Manhattan Distance between the location of the data and square 1.</p>
